# How to Release Nightly

## `tl;dr`
```
$ source sunbeam.sh

$ git-push-nightly-release v0.0.7

$ open https://github.com/dylt-dev/dylt/actions
```

If there are uncommitted changes, the script will confirm if the user wants to push the release anyway

All the required commands are in `sunbeam.sh`
